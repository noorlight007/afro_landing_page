      "With Afrobeutic’s intelligent chatbots, customers can easily express specific needs or request to speak with the salon manager. During the chat, the bot can ask if the customer would like to send a quote or message directly to the salon. If the customer agrees, the chatbot collects the necessary details and submits the request to the salon’s internal database. These requests are instantly visible to the salon admin through their Admin Panel, where they can review, respond, or take appropriate action. This ensures that customer concerns, special requirements, or queries are never missed. It creates a seamless bridge between the client and the salon management, enhancing responsiveness and service quality.",
